# PackageManagerAPI
Generic api to install programs in systems that uses package managers.


## Objective
  Abstract the use of system api's for install programs in different OS's. You can use apt or dnf, it'll work just fine for any of cases. Should be POSIX!
  I'm using in a project that is running while I do it, if you want to check it out: https://github.com/netoe1/fresh-installer <br>
  When I develop and refactor code
  I'll try to upload to pip.
